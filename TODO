### TODO
- consider replacing /etc/passwd -> root: detection pattern with /etc/resolv.conf -> nameserver or /etc/hosts -> localhost pattern (dockerized apps usually don't have passwd in the container)
- redirect support in scanner would also be nice, although seems a bit pain in the ass with the current API
- introduce best effort payloads
Add output encoding setting to the byte generator.

- UTF:
Directory Traversal Checklist:

16 bit Unicode encoding:
 . = %u002e, / = %u2215, \ = %u2216 

Double URL encoding:
. = %252e, / = %252f, \ = %255c     

UTF-8 Unicode encoding:   
. = %c0%2e, %e0%40%ae, %c0ae, / = %c0%af, %e0%80%af, %c0%2f, \ = %c0%5c, %c0%80%5c

- I don't think we ever generate payloads with the base value as suffix... https://t.co/tbI4Zfun7u ouch!
- mixed-encoding payloads ARE a good idea: https://hackerone.com/reports/307666
- Scanner integration for the LFI mode
- Scanner integration/full automation of the upload mode is also worth implementing - as an addition to semi-automated Intruder
- for foo.bar.com domains, add foobar, barfoo webroot targets
- consider /.. and ./ non-recursive filters
- add the ability to prefix the absolute path with the file:/// protocol handler
- add $ and > as default breakup sequences (works nice with python - these are automatically removed and not replaced with anything)
- add more configuration options:
  - windows evasive techniques (the ones mentioned here https://soroush.secproject.com/blog/2014/07/file-upload-and-php-on-iis-wildcards/)
  - any evasive techniques being a mix of \ and /? e.g. ....\/ -> rm ..\ -> ../
  - add the ability to append the filename with arbitrary characters (manageable just like the break-up strings - useful for LFI mode, but could as well be used to bypass extension controls - which will be implemented as another mode -> another payload generator to use, once we're already able to upload legitimate files to the webroot) + configurable list of benign extensions (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, whatever)
  - replace the lengthy screenshots with videos presenting different operation modes or a separate PDF
#### Nice-to-haves:
- test on different resolution, make sure the project is easily runnable/importable
- separate apache-like suffixes from the main list, they are there by default and do not go away once other than all/apache webroot set is picked
- more examples of test cases
- add a "Copy to clipboard" button for generated payloads, so the output payloads can be used with other tools
- add support for ZIP traversals
- extend the tool with extension control mode (defeating the filters in order to upload an executable - different tricks depending on the platform)??
- in case of a positive result, automatically track back the payload that did the trick (instead of the dir check mode?)
